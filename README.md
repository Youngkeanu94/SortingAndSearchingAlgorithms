Section 1: Bubble Sort
Implements the bubble sort algorithm in both ascending and descending orders on an array of student grades.
Demonstrates basic sorting techniques and array manipulation.

Section 2: Quick Sort
Applies the quick sort algorithm, again in both ascending and descending orders, to the same array.
Highlights a more efficient sorting method and provides a comparative understanding of different sorting algorithms.

Section 3: Sequential Search
Executes a sequential (or linear) search for specific values in the sorted array.
Illustrates a straightforward searching technique, emphasizing its application on sorted arrays.

Section 4: Binary Search
Implements a binary search algorithm to efficiently locate specific values in the sorted array.
Showcases a more advanced searching technique, suitable for sorted datasets, and demonstrates its efficiency over sequential search.
